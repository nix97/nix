Subject of various math problems on Numerical methods :

1. Partial Differential Equations(PDEs)
>>app PDEs Solver

The coverage of this problem are:
-Wave equation using Finite-Difference method
-Heat equation using Forward-Difference method
-Laplace's equation Dirichlet method
-Poisson's equation using Finite-Difference     method

2. System of Ordinary Differential Equation using Runge-Kutta fourth-order formula(RK4)
>>app System of ODE Solver

Solving of Two Differential Equation
Y'(t)=F(t,x,y) and
X'(t)=F(t,x,y) use IVP(Initial Value Problem)

3. Third-Order Differential Equation 
using Runge-Kutta fourth-order formula(RK4)
>>app Third-Order ODE Solver

Diff equation Y'''(t)=F(t,y,y',y'')
use IVP(Initial Value Problem)
